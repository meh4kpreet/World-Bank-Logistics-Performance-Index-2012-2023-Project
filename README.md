Pre vs Post-COVID Key Insights (2012â€“2023)
1. Overall Improvement in LPI Score Post-COVID:
Average LPI Score increased from 2.983 (2012â€“2019) to 3.046 (2020â€“2023), a 2.1% rise, showing slight recovery and adaptation in global logistics post-pandemic.

2. Infrastructure Score Improved Notably:
Rose from 2.871 to 2.977 (+3.65%), indicating improved logistics infrastructure development post-COVIDâ€”possibly due to digital upgrades and infrastructure reforms.

3. Logistics Competence & Quality saw highest % improvement:
Jumped from 2.933 to 3.075, a 4.84% riseâ€”signaling better skilled labor, operational efficiency, and tech integration in logistics.

4. Tracking and Tracing Efficiency also grew:
Increased by 3.5%, from 2.996 to 3.103â€”highlighting enhancements in visibility and digital monitoring tools in global supply chains.

5. Customs Procedures Became Slightly More Efficient:
Improved from 2.794 to 2.855 (+2.17%), indicating modest gains in clearance processes.
